Description: # SOLO
        The code is an unofficial pytorch implementation of [SOLO: Segmenting Objects by Locations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04488)
        
        
        ## Install
        The code is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). Please check [Install.md](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
        
        ## Training 
        Follows the same way as mmdetection.
        
        single GPU: python tools/train.py configs/solo/r50.py
        
        multi GPU (for example 8): ./tools/dist_train.sh configs/solo/r50.py 8 
        
        ## Notes
        
        The code only implements the simplest version of SOLO:
        
        * without CoordConv
        * using vanilla SOLO instead of Decoupled SOLO
        * 3x training schedule
        * using the default FPN featuremaps: in the paper it is with different specific strides and instance scale selection
        * implemented the simplest mask-nms: as the authors did not describe it in detail in the paper, the implemented nms is slow,  will improve it in the future.
        * **still in progress**
        
        ## Results
        
        After training 6 epoches on the coco dataset using the resnet-50 backbone, the AP is 0.091 on val2017 dataset:

        Both good and bad results:
